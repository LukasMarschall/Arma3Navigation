# Arma3Navigation
Project to implement different path finding algorithm in the military simulation Arma3

At the moment there are three different files:

## createRoadMap
Initializes the nodes on the map and creates a file to establish a navigation map

## dijkstraNavigation
Uses the Dijkstra Algorithm for pathfinfing

## astarNavigation
Uses the A Star Algorithm for pathfinfing

## status quo
Right now, everythings pumped into the file createRoadMap, so you only need to execute this single file.

Feel free to contact me on Steam, if any questions occur, the name is equivalent.

Cheers,

Luke
